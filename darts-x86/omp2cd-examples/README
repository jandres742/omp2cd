This directory contains OpenMP applications that have been translated
into DARTS code using the omp2cd compiler.

Each example contains a Makefile with the following basic rules:

- make omp (default):
Compiles the OpenMP application into a executable.

- make clean
Removes OpenMP executable and corresponding object files.

- make darts:
Compiles the OpenMP application into DARTS code using the omp2cd compiler.

- make clean-darts
Removes the generated DARTS code.

Paths to omp2cd and OpenMP libraries and compilation/linking options are defined in the top level
file Makefile.def. Modify this file according to your environment.

Generated DARTS applications rely on the library included in darts-lib, which contains functions
to read OpenMP variables and common base classes.
