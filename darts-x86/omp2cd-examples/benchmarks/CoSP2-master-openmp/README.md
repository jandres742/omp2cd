This is CoSP2 version 1.0
=========================

CoSP2 is a reference implementation of typical linear algebra
algorithms and workloads for a quantum molecular dynamics (QMD)
electronic structure code. The algorithm is based on a recursive
second-order Fermi-Operator expansion method (SP2) and is tailored
for density functional based tight-binding calculations of non-metallic
material systems. This SP2 algorithm is part of the Los Alamos 
Transferable Tight-binding for Energetics (LATTE) code, based on 
a matrix expansion of the Fermi operator in a recursive series 
of generalized matrix-matrix multiplications. 
It is created and maintained by The Exascale Co-Design Center
for Materials in Extreme Environments (ExMatEx). 
http://codesign.lanl.gov/projects/exmatex. The code is intended
to serve as a vehicle for co-design by allowing others to extend 
and/or reimplement it as needed to test performance of new 
architectures, programming models, etc.
