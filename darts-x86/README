================
Hello and thank you for downloading/taking interest in Darts, an asynchonous
fine-grained runtime based on the codelet model!  The following is designed to
get you off the ground.

This is a modified and improved version of DARTS aimed to support code generated
by the omp2cd compiler, although it can also be used with any DARTS code.

System requirements:
====================
- Pthreads.
- hwloc http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/
- Optional but recommended: TBB http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/

ATLAS libraries are needed for NWChem-SCF. Add the path to the libraries
and modify the corresponding lines as indicated in the CMakeLists.txt file.

BOOST queues may be used if desired on the TP schedulers(not used by default). If desired,
modify scheduler/TPScheduler.h and the CMakeLists.txt file as indicated in those files.

Steps to install:
=================
1. Create a director to build the source in the upper most directory
   $ mkdir build
2. Move into this directory
   $ cd build
3. Use Cmake to configure the build aiming at the top level CMakelist.txt
   $ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++
4. Build
   $ make
5. To install for other projects to use
   $ make install


Cmake Options:
==============
All of these options may be added when generating the makefiles in step 3.
1. Debug ie. compile with -g: -DDEBUG=ON
   By default cmake compiles in release mode ie. compiles with -O3
2. Install directory: -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="DIRECTORY/OF/YOUR/CHOICE"
   By defualt Darts will install in bash variable HOME/darts


Troubleshooting:
================
1. Cmake cannot find a hwloc/TBB
   First make sure you have hwloc/TBB installed on your system.
   Second cmake will look for hwloc/TBB in specific directories.  To find if you
   installation is located in on of these directories, navigate in your source
   to the cmake/Modules directory and view the FindHwloc.cmake/FindTBB.cmake
   file.  You may add your search path to these files rather than moving your
   installation.
